               <div class="heading-inner"><span style="margin: 0pt; float:left;"><strong>Have You Ever Considered Making Money Online?</strong></span></div>
               <br>
               <p><br>
               Mia Westbrook of New York was tired of worrying all the time where the next dollar is coming from. Life seemed merely a succession of bills and worrying about how to pay them. One late night while surfing the internet, her long hours of research had finally paid off and she discovered a tight lip secret to getting a break in life and making money online. She was finally able to provide for her three children while staying at home with them.</p>
               <p>I found Mia's blog last month and decided to feature her story. In our phone interview she told me her amazing story. "I basically make about $6,000-$8,000 a month online. It's enough to comfortably replace my old jobs income, especially considering I only work about 20 hours a week from home.</p>
               <p>Working online has been a big break for Mia, who struggled for many months going from one dead end job to another. "I lost my job after working for the same company for years, I needed reliable income, I was not interested in the "get rich quick" home programs you see all over the internet. Those are all pyramid schemes or stuff where you have to sell to your friends and family. I just needed a legitimate way to earn a living for me and my family. The best part of working online is that I am always home with the kids, I save a lot of money."</p>
               <h2>"<em>I basically make $6,000-$8,000 a month online.</em>"<br><span class="namebig"> -Mia Westbrook</span></h2>
               <p style="margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;">I asked her about how she discovered the tight lip secret. "Honestly, it is easier than you would think, all I did was fill out a simple form to get front line access to the <a href="javascript:OpenLink()">Home Profit System</a>. I got the instructions kit and within a month I was making over $4,000 a month. The instructions are pretty simple, I am not a computer whiz, but I can use the internet. I fill forms and surf sites, I don't even have to sell anything and nobody has to buy anything. It's as easy as being on Facebook."</p>
               </p>
               <p>Online giant Google, worth over 500 billion dollars is the most used search engine and internet market place. Google is the #1 internet site in the world, over 50 percent of all internet traffic flows through Google everyday. Using Google and the other search engines to make money online has been a eye-opener for Mia. There are plenty of schemes on the internet claiming you can make $50,000 a month, but that is exactly why they don't work. From my conversation with Mia, "I am making a good salary from home, which is amazing, under a year ago I was jobless as a single mom with three kids. I thank God every day I was blessed with these instructions and now it's my duty to pay it forward and share it with you." </p>
               <p>Quickly, Mia Westbrook was able to use the simple <a href="javascript:OpenLink()">Home Profit System</a> to change her life, forever.</p>

               <p>Mia had never shared her story before, this is the first time she's going public</p>

                                    <p>I am retired. That does not mean I am wealthy, it just means I have been receiving a fixed income in a world where the prices keep rising. I have tried several things, but since I am getting older, I realize that I need more income, but not an income where I have to produce more and more to keep up. Until a few months back, I had no idea how could I get some extra cash. So, I needed to find some things that an old guy like me can do to make money without having to do it forever. I am glad I found this because it proved to be exactly what I was looking for!!! I am receiving a steady paycheck each week using this system for the last 6 months now. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to earn some money online but is confused and not sure where to start.</p>

Just little over $250, but it was then when I realized this is the real deal and not yet another scam you see all over the internet! There are no words to describe the feeling you get when your first paycheck arrives and what excitement I felt at that moment realizing that making money from home is in fact very possible. After my first month I dedicated more time and put more effort in working this and my second month was already much more better (2nd paycheck I got was for $990)... Now, 6 months later, I am earning just over $2500 a month . I am a little slow with my work and I am not that good with computers and that's why I think a younger person could be able to earn much much more than this.</div>

What finally made me decide to try this system was that it came with a Money back Guarantee so I had nothing to lose and boy am I glad I decided to try this out. </div>

She was freshly divorced, with mortgage and with 3 hungry mouths to feed at home and it's safe to say her life was falling apart... But then one day she stormed through the door all excited to share the news with me how she finally managed to earn enough money while not leaving her house so she could be with her beautiful children even when she was working. She is one of the bravest persons I know. Luckily ,I am doing good financially now but if I ever needed extra money, this place would be my first stop. </div>

That means you determine for yourself when you are going to work and for how long... You can organize your work day yourself... Naturally the more effort and working hours you put into this, more profit you will get. Personally from my experience I can tell you that for working for 2h a day is enough for me to earn a paycheck of $1000 each week... Hope that helps ;)</div>

Anyone who decides to buy any program about making money will not necessarily make money simply by purchasing the program. People who think "I bought these materials so I'm going to automatically make money" are wrong. As any type of education has so many variables, it is impossible to accurately state what you may expect to achieve, however, people who bought the program not only bought the program, but also undertook additional training and education, applied the principles to an area of the market that was growing, kept their commitments and continued to learn. If you do what the individuals depicted did, you may generally expect to achieve a great education in the area of your choice, but you should not expect to earn any specific amount of money. Typical users of the starter materials that don't enroll in coaching, don't keep their commitments and don't implement what they learn, generally make no money. Though the success of the depicted individual is true, her picture and name have been changed to protect her identity. Consistent with the advertorial concept, the comments posted in the comment section are also representative of typical comments and experiences which have been compiled into a comment format to illustrate a dialogue, however, the comments are not actual posts to this webpage and have been compiled or generated for illustrative purposes only.</p></div>
